# sinkyl Devlog

A weekly engineering devlog tracking three projects built in parallel:

- **Bazaar** — A white-label e-commerce platform built with .NET microservices, event-driven architecture, and multi-tenant isolation
- **XtraNodly** — A visual graph execution engine in Rust with FPGA-inspired tick semantics, time travel debugging, and a wgpu-powered editor
- **Spatium** — A spatial neural network framework in Rust exploring 3D coordinate-addressed memory, Morton-encoded weight storage, and activation maps

Every week, real progress is documented — architecture decisions, code, patterns, tradeoffs, and what didn't work.
